# FOREWARNS workflow

These files comprise the workflow necessary to generateg FOREWARNS flood forecasts and proxies. The workflow routines are the shell scripts
  * master.sh $date $init (forecast generation workflow)
  * obs_master.sh $date (observations and flood forecast evaluation workflow)
  
The entire configuration is designed to be usable by a new user just by modifying directory variables ${gws_dir} and ${user_dir} within these shell scripts.

The workflows and all files called upoon therein depend critically upon the following directory structure.
Note that the structure is designed for use on the UK STFC JASMIN server; here gws_dir sits on a group-workspace disk (not backed-up, high storage disk), while 
user_dir sits in a user's home area (backed-up, lower storage capacity). Folders in <..> will be generated by the workflow.

A copy of this directory structure is provided. RainfallReferenceFiles and Shapefile contain files needed to generate flood forecasts; these are: 
  * catchment shapfiles for both Northern England and England + Wales (HydroBasins L9 dataset) (dir Shapefile).
  * list of catchment fid's and sample coordinates on UK OSNG (dir RainfallReferenceFiles)
  * DUMMY rainfall threshold values for catchment level flood return periods. True data values should be used for accurate forecasts; obtain FEH modelling data from https://fehweb.ceh.ac.uk/.Reference shapefile (GeoPlots) for enabling common return period legends (dir Shapefile)

Note that scripts are currently set to use dummy flood reference values; to change this, modify variable "refs" in extract_catchment_fcsts.py (l68) and FloodForecastLookup.py (l379).
