# FOREWARNS workflow

Generating FOREWARNS flood forecasts using the workflow files here provided depends upon the following directory structure, which is called upon by all scripts.
Note that the structure is designed for use on the UK STFC JASMIN server; here gws_dir sits on a group-workspace disk (not backed-up, high storage disk), while 
user_dir sits in a user's home area (backed-up, lower storage capacity). Folders in <..> will be generated by the workflow.

A copy of this directory structure is provided. RainfallReferenceFiles and Shapefile contain files needed to generate flood forecasts; these are:
    - catchment shapfiles for both Northern England and England + Wales (HydroBasins L9 dataset) (dir Shapefile).
    - list of catchment fid's and sample coordinates on UK OSNG (dir RainfallReferenceFiles)
    - DUMMY rainfall threshold values for catchment level flood return periods. True data values should be used for accurate forecasts; obtain FEH modelling data from 
      https://fehweb.ceh.ac.uk/.
    - Reference shapefile (GeoPlots) for enabling common return period legends (dir Shapefile)
Note that scripts are currently set to use dummy flood reference values; to change this, modify variable "refs" in extract_catchment_fcsts.py (l68) and FloodForecastLookup.py (l379).
